# Key Objectives
AUTOMATE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT:Reduce manual intervention and human errors by automating configuration tasks.
SCALABILITY: Easily manage and scale infrastructure, whether it involves a few servers or thousands.
CONSISTENCY ACROSS ENVIRONMENTS: Ensure that all systems are configured uniformly, reducing the risk of discrepancies between environments.

# Tools and Technologies
## Ansible
The core automation tool used for configuration management.
## YAML
 The language used for writing Ansible playbooks and configuration files.
## SSH
Secure Shell (SSH) for remote communication with target nodes.
## Linux/Unix Systems
The target operating systems managed through Ansible.

 # Installation Steps 
 ### 1-Clone the repository
 git clone https://github.com/LovekitChahal/Configuration-Management-Using-Ansible.git
 
### 2-Navigate to the project directory:
cd Configuration Management using Ansible

### 3-Install necessary Ansible roles and dependencies:
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
 # Usage Guide
 ## Step-1:  Define Inventory
Update the inventory file with the target nodes. Ensure that the IP addresses, SSH keys, and other connection details are correctly specified.

## Step-2: Customize Playbooks
Adjust the playbooks in the /playbooks directory as per your environment's requirements. Variables can be modified in the /vars directory to customize settings such as package names, configuration files, and more.

## Step-3: Run Playbooks
### Execute the main playbook to deploy configurations across your environment:

ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/site.yml 

### For staging environments:
ansible-playbook -i inventory/staging playbooks/site.yml

# Key Features Demonstrated
## Automated Web Server Setup
#### Task: 
Automatically set up and configure Apache/Nginx web servers.
#### Benefits:
Saves time and ensures all web servers are configured consistently across the network.
## Database Server Configuration
#### Task: 
 Deploy and configure MySQL/PostgreSQL servers with predefined settings.
 #### Benefits:
 Ensures databases are securely and consistently configured, reducing potential configuration drift.
 ## Role-Based Architecture
#### Task:
Implement a modular approach using Ansible roles for reusability.
#### Benefits: 
Simplifies maintenance and scaling by separating concerns into distinct, reusable roles.

## Environment-Specific Configuration
#### Task: 
Manage different environments (e.g., production, staging) with environment-specific settings.
#### Benefits: 
 Ensures that different environments are accurately configured to reflect their respective purposes.

 # Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I have honed my skills in:
#### Infrastructure Automation
#### Ansible Playbooks
#### Configuration Management
#### Scalable Solutions

# Challenges Faced
#### Environment Variability:
Dealing with the differences between production and staging environments required careful planning and testing.

#### Role Reusability: 
Ensuring that Ansible roles were both reusable and flexible enough to accommodate various scenarios.

# CONCLUSION
This project is a testament to my ability to automate and manage complex infrastructure environments using Ansible. By sharing this work, I aim to demonstrate my practical experience and readiness to take on challenging roles in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and automation engineering.
